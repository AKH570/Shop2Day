How do I delete DB (sqlite3) in Django 1.9 to start from scratch?

1.Delete the sqlite database file (often db.sqlite3) in your django project folder (or wherever you placed it)
2.Delete everything (delete all ".py" and ".pyc" files manually) except __init__.py file from migration folder in all django apps (eg: rm */migrations/0*.py)
3.Make changes in your models (models.py).
4.Run the command python manage.py makemigrations or python3 manage.py makemigrations
5.Then run the command python manage.py migrate


rm -f tmp.db db.sqlite3
rm -r my-app/migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
